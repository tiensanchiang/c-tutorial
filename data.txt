C  came into  being  in  the  years 1969-1973,  in  parallel with  the  early development  of  theUnix operating system; the most creative period occurred during 1972.  Another spate of changespeaked between 1977 and 1979, when portability of the Unix system was being demonstrated.  Inthe middle of this second period, the first widely available description of the language appeared:The C Programming Language,often called the ‘white book’ or ‘K&R’ [Kernighan 78].  Finally,in  the  middle  1980s,  the  language  was  officially  standardized by  the  ANSI  X3J11  committee,which made further changes.  Until the early 1980s, although compilers existed for a variety ofmachine  architectures  and  operating  systems,  the  language  was  almost  exclusively  associatedwith Unix; more recently, its use has spread much more widely, and today it is among the lan-guages most commonly used throughout the computer industry.
